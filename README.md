#### School of Code Bootcamp - Hackathon Week 4

###### October 2020

_Our Week 4 hackathon challenge was to build our first full stack app using Express and a Postgres database. It was a chance to embed everything we'd learnt so far on the bootcamp and great practice of breaking down problems into solvable chunks. I was so happy that I was able to make my first full-stack app with no help after just 4 weeks on the bootcamp - it felt awesome!_

### Hackathon Requirements

- Must use a Database for persistent storage
- Must use the model pattern to allow easy interaction with the data
- Must use an REST API server to manage requests and serve back data
- Must have a front end which allows users to at least view the data

### Main Learning Points:

- Making a detailed plan before we started doing any coding was essential and meant that we keep on track throughout the hackathon
- Reading errors messages and deciphering them! I'm learning to enjoy getting error messages and the problem solving that comes with fixing the bugs!
- Creating and building an Express app
- Using environment variables
- Getting more confident with connecting the backend and frontend together - I'm getting much better and quicker at this!
- Using PostgreSQL and creating a database with Heroku
- Writing scripts for our database, writing models and routes (`GET`, `POST` and `DELETE` all) for our backend functionality
- Displaying the data we received from the backend on the frontend. I was really pleased with how the data was presented in the table.

### Stretch Goals:

- Add functionality to delete rows by ID
